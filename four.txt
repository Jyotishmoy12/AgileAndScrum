Let's move on to the next step: **"Agile Methodology and its Benefits"** (30:16 - 42:30).

### Explanation for a 10-Year-Old

Think of Agile like building a Lego castle. Instead of trying to build it all at once and making it perfect, you build it bit by bit. 

- **What is Agile?**
  - Agile is a way of working that focuses on making small, useful pieces of a project quickly, then checking to see if everyone likes them. If they do, you keep going! If not, you can change it right away.

- **Why is Agile Good?**
  - **Faster Changes:** If you want to change how your Lego castle looks, it’s easy because you can just take off a few pieces and put on new ones!
  - **Teamwork:** Everyone can share their ideas and work together.
  - **Happy Customers:** By showing small parts of the project often, you can make sure everyone is happy with what you’re building.
