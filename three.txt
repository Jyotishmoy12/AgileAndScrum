**Scrum Artifacts**. These artifacts are essential tools that provide transparency and ensure accountability within a Scrum team. Let’s break it down:

### 16:04 - **Scrum Artifacts: Tools for Transparency and Accountability**

Scrum defines three key artifacts that help teams stay on track and ensure that everyone is aligned:

#### 1. **Product Backlog**:
   - The product backlog is an evolving list of everything that might be needed in the product. It is the single source of work for the Scrum team.
   - Items in the backlog are prioritized by the Product Owner, with the most important ones at the top, so the team knows what to focus on next.
   - The Product Backlog is never complete. As long as the product exists, the backlog evolves to reflect new ideas, changes, and feedback from users or stakeholders.

#### 2. **Sprint Backlog**:
   - The Sprint Backlog is the list of tasks the team commits to completing during a specific Sprint (usually 1-4 weeks).
   - It is a subset of the Product Backlog, containing only the highest priority items that the team can realistically accomplish within the Sprint.
   - The team owns the Sprint Backlog, and it evolves as the team progresses through the Sprint. If new tasks are identified, they are added to the Sprint Backlog.

#### 3. **Increment**:
   - The Increment is the sum of all completed Product Backlog items during a Sprint. It must be in a **"Done"** state, meaning it is ready for release or further testing.
   - Each Increment builds on the previous one, ensuring that progress is being made with each Sprint.

#### **Additional Artifacts**:
   - **Burndown Charts**: These charts show the team's progress towards completing the Sprint or the entire project. It visually represents how much work remains versus how much time is left.
   - **Definition of Done**: This is a shared understanding within the team about what it means for a product backlog item to be considered complete. It ensures quality and consistency.

#### Simple Explanation (Like for a 10-Year-Old)
The Scrum team uses some **lists and charts** to keep everything organized:
- The **Product Backlog** is like a big list of everything they need to do in the future.
- The **Sprint Backlog** is a smaller list of tasks they will finish in a short time, like for the next week.
- The **Increment** is what they’ve built so far, something that works and can be used.
- **Burndown Charts** are like a countdown of work, showing how much is left to finish.

#### 5. **What is the Definition of Done, and why is it important?**
